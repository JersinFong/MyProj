This is a program using AI search techniques to some future “time travelling” problems with some limited simplifications. 
it will take an input file that describes the time-travel configuration, the initial year-location, the target year-locations, and characteristics of the agent. For each target year-location, find the optimal (shortest) path from the initial year-location to that target year-location . A path is composed of a sequence of legal moves. Each legal move consists of moving the agent to one of its 8 neighbors in the same grid world in the current year, or a jaunting action through a time-travel channel at the current location.

implemented search algrithms: 
- Breadth-first search (BFS).
- Uniform-cost search (UCS).
- A* search (A*).
